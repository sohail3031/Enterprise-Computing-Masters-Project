<p>Complete? Yes</p>
<p>If Yes, briefly describe:</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>what you have done, We have utilized two distinct datasets. The first dataset, “tmdb_5000_credits.csv” includes movie ID, title, cast, and crew details. The second dataset, “tmdb_5000_movies.csv” comprises information such as movie ID, title, rating, vote count, average votes, etc. We merged these two datasets based on title column to create a new, comprehensive one. Then we cleaned the data to handle the missing values.</li>
<li>what are the new features. We have merged the two datasets and formed a new one. After data cleaning, we created a new column named “tags” which contains information from the overview, genres, cast, crew, and other similar columns.</li>
